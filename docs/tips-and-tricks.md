# Tips and tricks

## Adding the service name and navigation to your prototype

Some base HTML for the propositional navigation (which includes the service name) is included in the [views/includes](../app/views/includes). You should include it as a partial in your views. You also need to set `header_class` to `with-proposition`.

An example of this can be seen in the [question page example](../app/views/examples/question-page.html).
