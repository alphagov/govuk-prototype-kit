      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Cookies</h1>

      <p>The GOV.UK Prototype Kit puts small files (known as ‘cookies’) on to your computer.</p>

      <p>We use cookies to make prototypes work as well as possible.</p>

      <p>These cookies aren’t used to identify you personally.</p>

      <p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/">Find out how to manage cookies</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Storing users' answers within prototypes</h2>

      <p>To help prototypes work as well as possible, each prototype stores a cookie to remember what users select on question pages.</p>
      
      <p>This allows prototypes to have branching pages and show users' answers on pages like the 'Check your answers' summary page.</p>
