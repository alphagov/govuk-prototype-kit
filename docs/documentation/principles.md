# Principles

The prototype kit:

- is designed for prototyping, not for production code
- requires minimal skills to get started: HTML, CSS
- should be fully documented in a way that is accessible to the target audience
- makes use of existing GOV.UK tools and templates; the [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template), [GOV.UK front end toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) and [GOV.UK elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements)
- allows for server-side code
- can be extended - for example using NPM to install a module, access datastores, etc
- makes it easy to share prototypes with others online
