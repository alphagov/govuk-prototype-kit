# Principles

The GOV.UK Prototype Kit:

- is designed for prototyping, not for production code
- requires minimal skills to get started: HTML, CSS
- should be fully documented in a way that is accessible to the target audience
- makes use of [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend)
- allows for server-side code
- can be extended - for example using NPM to install a module, access datastores, etc
- makes it easy to share prototypes with others online
