# Updating to the latest version

1. [Download the zip file of the latest version of the Prototype Kit](/docs/download).

2. Unzip the zip file.

3. Make a backup copy of your prototype folder.

4. In your prototype, delete everything except the `app` and `.git` folders.

   You may not be able to see the `.git` folder because files and folders that start with `.` are hidden by default.

5. Copy all the folders from the unzipped folder to your prototype, except the `app` folder.

6. Replace the `app/config.js` file in your prototype with the `app/config.js` file from the unzipped folder.

7. Compare your new `config.js` file to the `config.js` file in the backup you made in step 3, and copy over anything you need to from the backup - for example your service name.

8. Copy `app/assets/sass/patterns` from the unzipped folder to your prototype.

9. Open the `app/assets/sass/application.scss` file in the unzipped folder.

10. Copy everything down to `// Add extra styles here`, then paste it into the `app/assets/sass/application.scss` file in your prototype so it replaces everything above `// Add extra styles here`.

11. Save the updated `app/assets/sass/application.scss` file in your prototype.

12. Check the [latest Prototype Kit release note](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/releases/latest) and follow any guidance on updating your prototype.

    If your prototype has not been updated for a long time, you should also follow any guidance in [release notes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/releases) between the version you're updating from and the latest version. You can find out the version you're updating from in the `VERSION.txt` file in your backup folder.

13. In your [terminal](/docs/install/requirements.md#terminal), `cd` to your prototype folder.

14. Run `npm install`.

    This may take up to a minute. You can ignore any lines in the log that start with `WARN`.

15. [Run the kit and check it works](/docs/install/run-the-kit).

If your prototype does not work, compare the new `package.json` file to the `package.json` file in the backup you made in step 3. Run `npm install PACKAGE-NAME` for each package that's missing in the new file.

## Gulp error message

If you use a GDS managed device, you no longer have permission to run Gulp (a JavaScript toolkit used by Prototype Kit). We’ve updated the Prototype Kit so if you install it now, it runs Gulp without having to install it separately.

If you want to run an existing prototype made before July 2021, you may see an error message about not having permission to run Gulp.

To fix this:

1. open a code editor, like Atom
2. from your prototype project folder, open the ‘start.js’ file
3. go to the line that starts with: var gulp = spawn
4. replace the entire line with:

`var gulp = spawn ('node', ['./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js', '--log-level', '-L'])`

5. save the file

If you need to restart the Prototype Kit after the fix:

1. in your [terminal](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/install/requirements.md#terminal), `cd` to your prototype folder
2. run `npm start`
