# Store your code online with GitHub and GitHub Desktop

GitHub is a way to store code online so you can collaborate with other people. It also makes it easier to publish your prototype online with Heroku.

Some concepts:

- Git - software that stores versions of your code
- GitHub - a website that shares your code online
- GitHub Desktop - an app that puts your code on GitHub
- Repository/repo - a project stored in Git

## Set up GitHub Desktop

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

2. [Download the GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/).

3. Run GitHub Desktop.

4. Sign in with your GitHub account details.

## Store your prototype in Git

1. Select **Add an Existing Repository** (if it's not on the screen, click the **File** menu and select **Add Local Repository**).

2. Set the **local path** to your prototype folder. Github Desktop will now show a warning, but do not worry - this is the correct process.

A screenshot of GitHub Desktop at this point:

A link titled 'Create a repository'. A button labelled 'Cancel'. And a button labelled 'Add repository'.](/public/images/docs/github-desktop-add-local-repository.png)

3. In the warning, click the **create a repository** link.

4. On the next screen, titled **Create a repository**, click the **Create repository** button.

## Upload your prototype to GitHub

1. In the top right, click **publish repository**.

2. Make sure **'Keep this code private'** is not ticked, as we need others to be able to see and collaborate on it.

3. Click **publish repository.**

Your prototype code is now on GitHub, which means other people can see and collaborate on your code.
