# Run the kit

You’ll use the terminal to start and stop the kit.

## Open the prototype folder in terminal

If you're following the installation guide, you'll already have the terminal open in the right folder.

If you're coming back to work on a prototype, you'll need to navigate to the folder:

```
cd ~/Documents/prototypes/juggling-licence
```

Or replace 'juggling-licence' with the name of your prototype.

## Running the kit

In the terminal, enter:
```
npm start
```

After the kit has started, you should see a message telling you that the kit is running:
```
Listening on port 3000 url: http://localhost:3000
```

## Check it works

In your web browser, visit <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000 (opens in a new tab)</a>

You should see the prototype welcome page.

It’s fine to leave the kit running for days or while your computer is asleep.

To quit the kit, in the terminal press the `ctrl` and `c` keys together.
