# Accessibility

The GOV.UK Prototype Kit website is maintained by a team at the Government Digital Service (GDS).

This page explains how the team works to ensure the Prototype Kit website is accessible.

## Accessibility statement for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit website

This accessibility statement applies to the GOV.UK Prototype Kit documentation website at https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com

The GOV.UK Prototype Kit team wants as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

The team has also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet has guidance on adjustments](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) you can make on your device to make it easier to use.

### Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

GDS is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

### Compliance status

The Prototype Kit website at [https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com](/) is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

### Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

#### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

Some pages do not have descriptive titles. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.2 (page titles). 

Some images do not have a good text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).

The text in the code examples cannot be resized using bowser controls. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.4 (resize text).

The code examples require scrolling horizontally on small screens. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (reflow).

Some code examples require scrolling within the element. This is not possible with a keyboard. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion 2.1.1 (keyboard).

The session is 4 hours long and cannot be extended. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion 2.2.1 (timing adjustable).

The kit uses an old version of the step by step pattern, in which it is not clear if elements are buttons or links. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships).

We plan to fix these issues by 31 March 2022.

### How the GOV.UK Prototype Kit team makes this website accessible

The GOV.UK Prototype Kit team works to ensure that the Prototype Kit website is accessible.

The team aims to research the Prototype Kit website with a representative range of users including those with disabilities.

We also test to ensure they work with a broad range of browsers, devices and assistive technologies - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools.
