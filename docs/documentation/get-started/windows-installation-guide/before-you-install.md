# Before you install the Prototype Kit

In some departments, you need admin access on your computer to install the Prototype Kit. If you do not have admin access, you can ask your IT team to install it for you.

To use the Prototype Kit on Windows, you will need:

- [an application called Git Bash](#git-bash)
- [some software called Node.js](#Node.js)
- [an code editor like Atom or Visual Studio Code](#html-text-editor)

This guide explains how to get these set up so you can install and use the Prototype Kit.

## Git Bash

You need to use a free application called Git Bash.

To get Git Bash, you need to [download Git for Windows (the download will start straight away when you select this link)](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the installation instructions.

Then, to open Git Bash:

1. Select the Windows or Start icon.
2. Go to the Programs list.
3. Open the Git folder.
4. Select the option for Git Bash.

This guide will give you some commands to enter into Git Bash, like this.

`Here is an example command`

When it does, either type or paste the command into Git Bash and press enter.

## Node.js

To use the Prototype Kit, you will need to use at least version 10 of a piece of free software called Node.js.

### Check if you have Node.js already

To find out if you already have Node.js installed, enter this command into Git Bash.

`node --version`

If you have Node.js already, Git Bash will give you a version number, like v10.15.1.

If the version number starts with 10, you have the correct version installed.

If the version number is lower than 10, like v.0.12.0 or v.5.0.0, you need to install a newer version of Node.js.

If you do not have Node.js installed at all, it will say 'Error 0x2 starting node.exe --version' and you need to install Node.js.

### If you need to install Node.js

You can download and install Node.js from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Choose the version marked LTS, which stands for long term support, and follow the installation instructions.

Once you have installed Node.js, quit and restart Git Bash. To check it's installed correctly, enter the following command again.

`node --version`

If it’s installed correctly, Git Bash will now show a version number starting with 10.

## Code editor

You will need to download an code editor to work on your prototype.

There are a number of free code editors to choose from, like [Atom](https://atom.io/)&nbsp;or&nbsp;[Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
