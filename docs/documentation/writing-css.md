# Writing CSS

CSS used in the prototype kit is written in the SCSS syntax of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax). 

## Sass

Sass is an extension of CSS that gives a load of extra features useful in producing CSS for the mass of different devices and browsers. 

SCSS was chosen because you can paste CSS into it without breaking it which is useful for prototyping. Using SCSS means you can also use the [govuk_frontend_toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) Sass libraries which include styles for colours, typography, cross-browser fixes and other things which are used across GOV.UK.

## We use Node Sass

The prototype kit uses [node-sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass), a node version of of [lib-sass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass). It's still a work in progress and so you may find a few things don't work, the most important of which is that [@extend](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#extend) mostly doesn't. 

We found most other features are in and development is progressing quick enough to work with most prototypes (any bugs we found were quickly fixed). Note that `@extend` is used in just one place in the toolkit: the `clear-floats` @extend in [_shims.scss](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit/blob/master/stylesheets/_shims.scss).

For the latest details of what's supported, check [this article](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/01/state-of-libsass/).

#### Why use Node Sass?

We use node-sass for one reason: to keep it as quick as possible to get up and running. It means you have only one thing to do, get Node. Do that and you can run the app.

#### Help, I need features Node Sass doesn't have yet

Your best bet is to use the Ruby version of Sass to compile your SCSS. Functionality for this out of the box will be added soon. Until then, check the docs on using the [Sass command-line tool](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass) or swap out the [grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass) plugin for [grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass).

## Writing code

You write your Sass in [app/assets/sass](../app/assets/sass) and the prototype kit will compile it into the CSS used in your page (found in /public/stylesheets). The app watches your files so this will happen automatically.

There is already a CSS file included to use called [application.scss](../app/assets/sass/application.scss) which compiles into [application.css](../public/stylesheets/application.css). Note that Sass files are identified by the `.scss` extension.

Every time a change happens in [application.scss](../app/assets/sass/application.scss) it will produce a new version of [application.css](../public/stylesheets/application.css). Make sure to write your css in [application.scss](../app/assets/sass/application.scss) as anything you put in [application.css](../public/stylesheets/application.css) will get overridden.

Try starting the app and adding some styles to `application.scss`. If you open `application.css` you should now see the compiled version of those styles.

## Using the govuk_frontend_toolkit

You can use the Sass libraries in the [govuk_frontend_toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) by importing the files from there directly into `application.scss`.

If you look at [application.scss](../app/assets/sass/application.scss) you should see some are already being used.

    @import '_typography';

    ....

    h1 {
      @include bold-48;

The line `@import '_typography';` makes all the code in [_typography.scss](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit/blob/master/stylesheets/_typography.scss) available. The `h1` can therefore be styled in the 48pt bold form of the font by using `@include bold-48;` to call the `bold-48` mixin.

## Imports

Imports are done from either the toolkit's [stylesheets](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit/tree/master/stylesheets/) folder or the [app/assets/sass](../app/assets/sass) folder application.scss sits in. The later means you can create your own partial files to import. 

Note that the convention is to start the name of any partial with an underscore, like those in the toolkit.
