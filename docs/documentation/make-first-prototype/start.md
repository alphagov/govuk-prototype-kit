# Build a basic prototype using the Prototype Kit

This tutorial shows you how to prototype a fictional 'Apply for a juggling licence' service that will:

- show the user's answers for them to check
- show a confirmation page

It will take about an hour to finish this tutorial, after you install the Prototype Kit.

Our prototype will look a bit like this:
