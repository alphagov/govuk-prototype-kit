# Link your index page to your start page

You can route users from your service's index page to your start page. The index page is the page that loads when users [go to http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

1. Open the `index.html` file in your `app/views` folder.
2. Add an `<a>` tag that links to `/start`.

You can now find out [how to publish your prototype online](/docs/publishing-on-heroku), so you can share it with your team or do user research.
