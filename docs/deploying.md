# Deploying (getting your work online)

## Options

1. [Heroku (Recommended)](#heroku)
2. [Docker (Advanced)](#docker)

## Heroku

We recommend using [Heroku](http://wwww.heroku.com) to get your prototype online. It's simple and 
fast to deploy new versions as you work.

### Getting started
#### 1) If you're new to Heroku, get an account and install their toolbelt

https://toolbelt.heroku.com/

#### 2) Deploy for the first time

In the folder of your prototype, run:

`heroku apps:create [name]`

[name] will be the address of your prototype online. For example if you run:

`heroku apps:create my-prototype`

Your prototype would then be available online at [http://my-prototype.herokuapp.com](#)

#### 3) Deploy changes

If you make a change to your prototype, commit your changes as usual then run:

`git push heroku master`

to push your changes to Heroku

### Deploying different versions

We have found its helpful to have at least two different versions of a prototype online.

1. **dev** - an experimental version, where things change rapidly and may well be broken
2. **master** - a stable version, where other people can rely on seeing a working version of the 
   prototype that you're happy with

If you've followed the instructions above, you already have a master version online.

Create a dev branch:

`git checkout -b dev`

Add a dev heroku remote:

`heroku apps:create --remote dev [dev-name]`

Push to the dev remote:

`git push dev dev:master`

Now your dev branch will be live at [dev-name].herokuapp.com

Note that you have to add 'dev:master' this time - if you dont add this, Heroku assumes you want the
master branch to be deployed.

### Adding authentication

If you don't want the wider world to be looking at your prototype then you can add some basic 
username/password authentication. Only one set of credentials is supported at this time.

You just need to set some environment variables on your Heroku instance. You can do this in the 
Heroku admin console (under Settings â–¶ Config Variables) or by running the following shell commands:

`heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production`
`heroku config:set USERNAME=username_here`
`heroku config:set PASSWORD=password_here`

Your app will now prompt you for a password when accessed on Heroku (but not when running locally).

## Docker

This is primarily designed for people with some experience of DevOps, however you can try out the 
container for yourself.

Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit 
for software development. This includes standardising how ports are exposed, giving the application 
it's own isolated filesystem, and standardising how to run the application.

This project includes a [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) to build a container, and a 
[docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) to test it.

### Installing a Development Docker

#### Windows/OS X

Install docker-machine. You can get this from the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox).

Create a docker machine

```shell
docker-machine create -d virtualbox prototypekit
```

Then every time you want to have a shell set-up to use docker run this command

```shell
docker-machine start prototypekit
eval $(docker-machine env prototypekit)
```

#### Linux

Simply install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/)


### Starting the Container

Run 

```shell
docker-compose up
```

You'll then see the server start.
