      <p>
        This kit lets you rapidly create HTML prototypes of internal Home Office services.
      </p>

      <p>
        It contains all you need to prototype anything from simple static pages to complex, data-driven transactions.
        It's based on the <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a>, which:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>is styled for internal Home Office applications
          <li>has additional Home Office components
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About this page</h2>

      <p>We recommend you add links to your prototype to this page, rather than delete it.
        You'll find this page in the kit at '/app/views/index.html'.</p>

      <p>You can change the service name by editing the file '/app/config.js'. This will appear in the header.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Use this prototyping kit</h2>

      <p>We've extended the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK design system</a> for additional use cases and users, including internal services.</p>

      <p>They have been developed by the Home Office research and design teams to help develop and create consistent, usable services.</p>

      <p>Learn more about the <a href="https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Office design system</a> including example components and guidance on usage.</p>

      <p>We recommend you don't change the Home Office styles, found in 'app/assets/sass/home-office'. If you find a problem or a user need to change a pattern, <a href="https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/get-involved">contribute to the design system</a> which will help us to improve it so that everyone can benefit.</p>
