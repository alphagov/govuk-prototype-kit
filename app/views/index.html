      <p>
        This kit lets you rapidly create HTML prototypes of GOV.UK and internal Home Office services.
      </p>

      <p>
        It contains all you need to prototype anything from simple static pages to complex, data-driven transactions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About this page</h2>

      <p>We recommend you add links to your prototype to this page, rather than delete it.
        You'll find this page in the kit at '/app/views/index.html'.</p>

      <p>You can change the service name by editing the file '/app/config.js'.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Using the Home Office design patterns</h2>

      <p>These patterns extend the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design">GOV.UK design patterns</a> for additional use cases and users, including internal services.</p>

      <p>They have been developed by the Home Office research and design teams to help develop and create consistent, usable services.</p>

      <p>Learn more about the <a href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com">Home Office design guide and patterns library</a> including example components and guidance on usage.</p>

      <p>Styles specific to these patterns are included in this kit. Take a look at the individual Sass files to understand the detail behind a pattern.</p>

      <p>The individual pattern files are imported into the main <code class="code">application.scss</code> file, ready to use.

      <p>We do not recommend you edit these files. If you find a problem or a user need to change a pattern, please <a href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/process/contribute">contribute to the patterns library</a> which will help us to improve it so that everyone can benefit.</p>
