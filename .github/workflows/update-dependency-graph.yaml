# GitHub's dependency graph only provides support for package-lock.json manifest
# files [1], but we're using npm-shrinkwrap.json.
#
# So that we still get the benefit of the dependency graph, for example
# Dependabot alerts, update the dependency graph by generating a software bill
# of materials (SBOM) and sending it to the  dependency submission API [2] using
# the advanced-security/spdx-dependency-submission-action action.
#
# The generated SBOM is also uploaded as an artifact for debugging.
