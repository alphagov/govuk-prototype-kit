# 11.0.0 (Fix release)

## Fixes

We’ve recently experienced 2 security incidents involving common NPM packages used by the Prototype Kit. We’re sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.

We’ve added new measures (a package-lock.json file) to help prevent this in the future. 

To protect your service from any similar threats in future, please upgrade to this new version of the Kit.

[Install the Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/install)

For any existing prototypes, follow the guide to [update the kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/updating-the-kit).

# 10.0.0 (Breaking release)

## Breaking changes

You must make the following changes if you’re running Node.js 10 and you update to this release, or your prototype may break.

### Update from Node.js 10

You can no longer run the GOV.UK Prototype Kit on Node.js 10.

If you currently run Node.js 10, you'll need to upgrade to a newer version. 

We recommend using version 16. You can find more information on the [Prototype Kit requirements page](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/install/requirements.md).

### Upgrade Notify client library from version 4.7.2 to 5.1.0

We have updated the Notify client library to version 5.1.0. This may break existing prototypes that are using the Notify client. Big thanks to [David McDonald](https://github.com/idavidmcdonald).

## Breaking change pull requests

- [Pull request #925: Upgrade Notify client library from 4.7.2 to 5.1.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/pull/925). This may break existing prototypes which are using the Notify client. If you have any issues, please [contact the GOV.UK Prototype Kit team](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-in-touch/).

# 9.15.0 (Feature release)

## New features

### Update to GOV.UK Frontend 3.14.0

Added in [Pull request #1108: Update to GOV.UK Frontend v3.14.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/pull/1108)

This release contains:
- new override classes for text alignment
- changes to the `govuk-spacing` function to allow negative spacing
- a fix for an accessibility issue with the panel component

### Replace back link placeholder URLs with JavaScript

We've added JavaScript to make the [back link component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/back-link/) take users to the previous page by default, rather than you having to update placeholder text.

If you want to use JavaScript in production, you must also use a non-JavaScript alternative, so you do not exclude any users. If you cannot use a non-JavaScript alternative, you should hide the back link when JavaScript is not available.

You can still override the `href` attribute if you need to provide a solution that works when JavaScript is disabled.

This was added in [Pull request #1103: Replace back link placeholder URLs with JavaScript](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/pull/1103)

### Update Node.js to protect your code

If you use the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, we recommend you update to use the latest version of Node.js 14 Long Term Support (LTS). This is to make sure you're protected from a [recent security vulnerability in the npm (Node Package Manager)](https://github.blog/2021-09-08-github-security-update-vulnerabilities-tar-npmcli-arborist/).

To make sure you're using Node.js version 14.17.6 or later, [follow the install instructions on the Prototype Kit website](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/install/requirements.md#nodejs-version-14-lts).

If you're using Node Version Manager (nvm), you can instead [run `nvm install` to install v14.17.6](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/pull/1076).

### Make Sass errors clearer to users

Previously, it was not obvious to users if Sass had stopped updating because of an error. An error would be printed to the command line, but nothing would happen in the browser. We know that this error was easy to miss, which could cause confusion.

Now, when there's a Sass error, the GOV.UK Prototype Kit creates a blank `application.css` file to make the site look broken to users.

If you fix the Sass error, the site will automatically reload.

We have also changed the [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) log level to be less detailed, so that errors stand out.

This was added in [Pull request #990: Make Sass errors clearer to the user](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/pull/990).

### Opt in to the new GOV.UK Frontend link styles

Links now have underlines that are consistently thinner and a bit further away from the link text.

Links also have a clearer hover state, where the underline gets thicker to make the link stand out to users.

The new link styles are opt-in because [Chromium browsers have an issue with links inside a multi-column layout](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2204).

Read more about the new link styles in the [GOV.UK Frontend release notes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases).

This was added in [Pull request #1012: Implement the new link and hover styles in the Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/issues/1012).

### Updated task list template

The task list pattern has been updated to make incomplete tasks clearer to users. This change [has also been made to the pattern in the Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/task-list-pages/).

If you're updating from an older version, in your `app/assets/sass/patterns/task-list.scss` file add the line `.app-task-list__tag,` before `.app-task-list__task-completed {`:

```scss
.app-task-list__tag,
.app-task-list__task-completed {

### Use Prototype Kit-specific patterns in the unbranded template

You can now use patterns like [step by step navigation](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/templates/step-by-step-navigation) and [task lists](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/templates/task-list) in the [unbranded template](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/templates/blank-unbranded).

You do not need to do anything if you're installing this version for the first time.

If you're upgrading from an older version, make the following changes.

1. In the `app/assets/sass/unbranded.scss` file, change `@import "node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/all";` to `@import "application";`.
2. In the `app/views/layout_unbranded.html` file, change `{% extends "govuk/template.njk" %}` to `{% extends "layout.html" %}`.

# 9.0.0 (Breaking release)

This release updates GOV.UK Prototype Kit to v3.0.0 of GOV.UK Frontend.

In v3.0.0 of GOV.UK Frontend, we’ve made some important changes to [improve the accessibility of pages](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/29/weve-made-the-gov-uk-design-system-more-accessible). This includes making sure that the styles, components and patterns in GOV.UK Frontend meet [WCAG 2.1 level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

You must follow our [guidance on updating your version of the Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/updating-the-kit).

If you need help updating or installing the Prototype Kit, you can:

- [contact the GOV.UK Design System team](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-in-touch/)
- talk to a developer on your team

## Breaking changes

You must make the following changes when you migrate to this release, or your prototype may break.

1. Update files in the `/app` folder - unless you [updated via the command line](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/updating-the-kit#updating-via-the-command-line-advanced-).
2. Update HTML in GOV.UK Frontend components.

If you’ve created custom code or components, read the [release notes for GOV.UK Frontend v3.0.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for more changes you may need to make.

### Update files in the app folder

To make sure GOV.UK Frontend's files do not conflict with your code, we've moved our package files into a directory called `govuk`.

If you [downloaded this version of the Prototype Kit as a zip file](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/updating-the-kit#steps), you must:

- add an assets path in the Sass file
- replace old colours
- update asset paths
- update the layout file
- update the layout_unbranded file

Pull requests:

- [#1458: Namespace nunjucks and components](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1458)
- [#1467: Update the main entry point in package.json](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1467)

#### Add an assets path in the Sass file

In the `app/assets/sass/application.scss` file, add `$govuk-assets-path: '/govuk/assets/';` at the top.

#### Replace old colours

In the `app/assets/sass/patterns/_step-by-step-navigation.scss` file, replace:

- `“grey-4”` with `"light-grey", $legacy: "grey-4"`
- `“grey-3”` with `"light-grey", $legacy: "grey-3"`

You must make this change even if you are not using the step by step navigation pattern in your prototype.

Read our [blog post about why we changed the colour palette](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/29/weve-updated-the-gov-uk-colours-and-font/).

#### Update asset paths

In the `app/assets/sass/unbranded.scss` file, add `govuk/` after `govuk-frontend/` in the 3 `@import` paths. For example:

```scss
@import "node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/settings/colours-palette";
```

#### Update the layout file

1. Go to the `app/views/layout.html` file.
2. Add `{%- set assetPath = '/govuk/assets' -%}` at the top.
3. Replace `{% extends "template.njk" %}` with `{% extends "govuk/template.njk" %}`.
4. In each import line that starts `{% from`, add `govuk/components/` to the start of the file path. For example:

```javascript
{% from "govuk/components/accordion/macro.njk"        import govukAccordion %}
```

5. Add `{% set mainClasses = mainClasses | default("govuk-main-wrapper--auto-spacing") %}` before `{% if useAutoStoreData %}`

#### Update the layout_unbranded file

In the `app/views/layout_unbranded.html` file:

1. Add `{%- set assetPath = '/govuk/assets' -%}` at the top.
2. Replace `{% extends "template.njk" %}` with `{% extends "govuk/template.njk" %}`.

[Pull request #769: Update to GOV.UK Frontend 3.0.0.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/pull/769/files)

### Update HTML in GOV.UK Frontend components

#### Update and add data-module attributes

If you’re using HTML versions of GOV.UK Frontend components, add a `govuk-` prefix to `data-module` attribute values. For example:

```html
<div class="govuk-accordion" data-module="govuk-accordion">
...
</div>
```

If you’re using HTML versions of the button or details component, add:

- `data-module="govuk-button"` to each `<button>` HTML tag
- `data-module="govuk-details"` to each `<details>` HTML tag

[Pull request #1443: Ensure GOV.UK Frontend component selectors cannot conflict when initialised.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1443)

#### Update the character count CSS class name

If you're using the HTML version of the character count component, change `js-character-count` to `govuk-js-character-count`.

[Pull request #1444: Renames `js-` css prefix to `govuk-js-`.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1444)

#### Update links from error summary components to radios and checkboxes

If you've linked from an error summary component to the first input in a [radios](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/) or [checkboxes](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes/) component, the link will no longer work.

This is because the `id` of the first input no longer has the suffix `-1`.

If there are links back to radios or checkboxes components in your error summary component, remove `-1` from the end of the `href` attribute.

[Pull request #1426: Make radios and checkboxes components easier to link to from error summary.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1426)

#### Update markup if you’re using the tab component

If you’re using the HTML version of the tabs component, remove the `govuk-tabs__tab--selected` class from the first tab's link, then add the `govuk-tabs__list-item--selected` class to the link's parent list item.

For example:

```html
<li class="govuk-tabs__list-item govuk-tabs__list-item--selected">
  <a class="govuk-tabs__tab" href="#tab1">
    Tab 1
  </a>
</li>
```

[Pull request #1496: Update the focus state for tabs.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1443)

#### Update markup if you’re using the task list component

Update every item in your task list, removing the `app-task-list__task-name` class from the link and wrapping the link in a new `<span class="app-task-list__task-name">`.


For example:

 ```html
<li class="app-task-list__item">
  <span class="app-task-list__task-name">
    <a href="#" aria-describedby="eligibility-completed">
      Check eligibility
    </a>
  </span>
</li>
```

[Pull request #770: Update the task list focus state.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/pull/770)

#### Update start button icon

[Start buttons](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/#start-buttons) have a new icon. Your start buttons will lose their current icons unless you replace the old icon with the new one.

If you're using Nunjucks:

- set the `isStartButton` option to `true`
- remove the `.govuk-button--start` class

For example:

```javascript
govukButton({
  text: "Start now",
  href: "#",
  isStartButton: true
})
```

If you're using HTML, add the SVG code from the [start button example in the Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/#start-buttons).

[Pull request #1341: Add new start button icon.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1341)

## New features

### Page wrappers now use auto spacing

The `<main>` element in layouts now has a `.govuk-main-wrapper--auto-spacing` class by default.

This will add the correct amount of padding above the content, depending on whether there are elements above the `<main>` element inside the `govuk-width-container` wrapper. Elements above the `<main>` element could include a back link or breadcrumb component.

If `govuk-main-wrapper--auto-spacing` does not work for your service, you can set the correct amount of padding by adding the `.govuk-main-wrapper--l` class to your page or layout by using:

 ```js
{% set mainClasses = "govuk-main-wrapper--l" %}
```

You can also turn off the `.govuk-main-wrapper--auto-spacing` class by using:

 ```js
{% set mainClasses = "" %}
```

### Continue to use the old colours

If you want to continue using old colours in your prototype, you can [turn on compatibility mode](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/compatibility.md).
