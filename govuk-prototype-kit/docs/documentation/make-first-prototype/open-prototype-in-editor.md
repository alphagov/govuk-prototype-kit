## Overview of folders in the Prototype Kit

 - `/app` is for your work. Inside that folder:
  - `views` is for HTML pages
  - `assets` is for CSS, JavaScript, images and downloadable files
  - `routes.js` is for advanced logic - for example, if a user should go to one page or another based on their answers. We'll cover it later.
 - `/docs/views/templates` has template pages for you to copy into your prototype
